# Task Manager

###### The project

This project is a simple program built for a small business to help manage tasks. This is an updated version of Task-Manager-Files and makes use of lists, functions and string handling to operate more efficiently.

###### Usefulness

The program is useful in the sense that it works with data stored in text files that user's are able to add to and edit. The program allows user's to be registered in a system, log in, add tasks, view all tasks, view tasks assigned to them, generate reports to text files and display statistics from the text files. Some operations are only accessible by the admin user. This way task management becomes very straightforward and simple for small businesses to use.
